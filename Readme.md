 Arduino library to use Proove/Anslut/Telldus 433MHz sockets

Clone of [Joakim Wesslen's Tx433](https://github.com/JoakimWesslen/Tx433) which uses less memory and flash allowing it to run on Attiny85 as well as Arduino.
Example uses 1426 bytes of flash and 12 bytes of global variables.

Tested with a [Telldus 14189 433 MHz socket](https://telldus.com/produkt/round-outlet-433-mhz/) on Arduino Uno and Digispark Attiny85.
